# Apache Beam Wheels

## Overview

`beam-wheels` is a helper repository of [apache beam](https://github.com/apache/beam), which helps a Release 
Manager build python wheels on Linux/MacOS in a release process.

## Structure

There are 2 major parts in this repository.
* [multibuild](https://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild) as git submodule, helps build python wheels based on different os.

* [travis](https://travis-ci.com/) configuration files, setups environment variables and deployment strategy.
  
  * `.travis.yml` contains a set of [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) and steps of build process.
  * `deploy_travis.sh` defines that final python wheels will be deployed to [dist.apache.org/dev](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/beam/)
    using svn with your apache credential.
  * `config.sh` defines custom build steps.

## User Guide

* Create and push a new branch(e.g. release-2.6.0) into the beam-wheels repository, which will trigger the travis build of that version. Found your build in https://travis-ci.org/apache/beam-wheels.

* Confirm that build successful and wheels get staged in `beam-wheels-staging` gcs bucket ([link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/beam-wheels-staging?project=apache-beam-testing)).
